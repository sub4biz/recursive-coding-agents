# RLM rubric — the yardstick

Use this to decide whether a system is a full **Recursive Language Model (RLM)**, an RLM-family ablation, or merely RLM-adjacent. The example folders ([`../claude-dynamic-workflows/`](../claude-dynamic-workflows/) and [`../openprose/`](../openprose/)) are classified against it.

- **`rlm-rubric.md` / `rlm-rubric.json`** — the definition, the seven hard gates **G1–G7**, the classification ladder, and the "why close systems are not RLMs" table. A system is a full RLM only if it passes **all** of G1–G7.
- **`rlm-judging-methodology.md` / `rlm-judging-methodology.json`** — how to judge a target with observed evidence, negative controls, and adversarial review. It treats the rubric as a conformance contract.

**One-line definition.** An RLM moves the task context into a persistent executable environment as symbolic state, lets the root model work through handles and metadata, and lets the model write programs that inspect, slice, and recursively call sub-LMs or subagents over those slices — returning the final answer through the same model-call interface.

**Judging stance.** Be generous about nearby coding-agent shapes: credit subagents, loops, bash, durable files, repo handles, and symbolic state when a specific run actually has them. A system becomes a full RLM only when all seven gates hold together, especially programmatic calls over model-constructed slices or subproblems and model-chosen decomposition.

**The seven hard gates.** G1 model-call outer shape · G2 prompt externalization · G3 symbolic handle · G4 persistent executable environment · G5 programmatic subcalls · G6 model-chosen decomposition · G7 symbolic intermediate state.
