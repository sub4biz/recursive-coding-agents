# OpenProse programs: RLM vs not-RLM

OpenProse programs are Markdown contracts (`*.prose.md`) executed by the OpenProse VM. This folder classifies them against [`../rlm-rubric/`](../rlm-rubric/). **The folder a file lives in is the intended verdict for that contract shape**, and every negative filename also ends in `-not-rlm`.

## `rlm/` — RLM-complete contracts (intended to pass G1–G7)

- `handle-recursive-reader.prose.md` — strict recursive reader over an opaque handle.
- `directory-handle-slicer.prose.md` — slices a directory handle into sub-handles and recurses.
- `opaque-handle-map-reduce.prose.md` — model-driven map-reduce over an opaque handle.

These are contract-level fixtures rather than public run transcripts. They are classified by the behavior the VM contract requires: handles, persistent state, recursive calls over child handles, bounded fanout/depth, and symbolic aggregation.

## `not-rlm/` — nearby shapes that FAIL a gate (calibration)

These examples are intentionally graded generously: if a coding-agent-like shape has a persistent runtime, a handle, symbolic files, subagents, or loops, credit that mechanism. The verdict should turn on the missing RLM gate, not on a vague "agents are not RLMs" shortcut.

- `subagents-only-not-rlm.prose.md` — delegates the same already-inlined prompt to reviewers. Even if the reviewer fanout is counted as model calls, there is no external prompt handle, no model-constructed slice manifest, and no symbolic handle state, so it fails **G2/G3/G7** and does not satisfy the **G5** requirement for programmatic calls over constructed slices or subproblems.
- `bash-only-symbolic-reader-not-rlm.prose.md` — reads context symbolically with bash but never makes programmatic sub-LM calls, so it **fails G5**.
- `ralph-loop-not-rlm.prose.md` — a coding-agent-style outer loop over a handle. Grant it the executable environment and handle-shaped context. It is still not a full RLM because it does not recursively call over child handles, does not aggregate independent child results, and the outer loop owns continuation and stopping, so it **fails G5/G6/G7**.
